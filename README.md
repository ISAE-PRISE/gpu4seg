# GPU4SEG project

Copyright (C) 2023 ISAE-SUPAERO

The objective of this project is to study the response of image Segmentation CNN models to architectural (e.g. nÂ° of levels, layer or channels) and implementation (e.g. GPU utilization, convolution execution) modifications.
Please note that the code and data publicly released in this repository is a subset of a major production.  

## Description

1. "pytorch/": This workspace contains the Pytorch envrionment to train the different Segnet architectures.

2. "cuda/segnet/": This workspace contains the CUDA code for executing different Segnet architectures making use of traditional convolutions and 2x2 output tiles Winograd convolutions.
						  
						  
## Hardware/Software Requirements

1. NVIDIA GPU. Tests were conducted using CUDA 11.4, and Jetson AGX Orin 64 GB and Jetson Xavier NX as MPSoCs.
   
2. stb libraries for importing and exporting images. Git: https://github.com/nothings/stb

3. Datasets. UAVID and UDD were used. The released testing code is configured for UAVID. FOr this dataset, the static and moving cars were assumed to belong to the same class. 

4. Binary files with the filter weights and normalization values. The training was performed using Pytorch.
